# AWS Lift and Shift

## Overview

**AWS Lift and Shift** is a cloud migration project that showcases how to move an on-premise application to the cloud with minimal changes. The project leverages various AWS services like **EC2**, **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**, **Auto Scaling**, **S3 Storage**, and **Route 53** to replicate the on-premise architecture in the AWS cloud.

## Architecture

The architecture replicates an on-premise environment by utilizing key AWS services such as **EC2** for compute instances, **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** for distributing traffic, **Auto Scaling** for handling traffic spikes, **S3** for storage, and **Route 53** for DNS routing.

## Features

- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Uses EC2, ELB, and Auto Scaling to automatically handle traffic and server loads.
- **Reliable Storage**: Leverages S3 for storing static content such as images and backups.
- **Custom Domain**: Uses Route 53 for DNS management to map custom domains to the cloud infrastructure.
- **Zero Downtime**: Ensures zero downtime during the migration by utilizing Auto Scaling and Load Balancing.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS Services**: EC2, ELB, Auto Scaling, S3, Route 53
